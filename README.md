# Javascript Hashing Algorithm - Linear Probing
A simple Hashing algorithm in Javascript, which uses Linear Probing to resolve collisions.

To use the functions, open the JS in a terminal, either by HTML or with Repl.it.
The Hash algorithm is not perfect, it's just my first implementation of this data structure.  

The line of code with modulus (%) uses a constant 37 although most algorithms use the array length or some other constant.
37 proved to be a good constant.
